# Python scripts

Some python scripts. One I made to counteract anchoring effects when making probability estimates (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring). Another I wrote up when I was maintaining a large set of images on dropbox and needed to deal with duplicates.
PyClipper is a script for automatically downloading the histories of all the cards on your clippercard account, because www.clippercard.com does not have a usable API.
